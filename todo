- rename Shared DbWrapper or something
- split up models.rs into a db module and one file per model, put the relavent methods for DbWrapper inside said file
- switch to rusqlite and use connection pools (?)
- use once_cell instead of lazy_static
- maybe use unnamed channels (which are allowed due to just being able to put any uuid as the channel uuid) as DM channels??
